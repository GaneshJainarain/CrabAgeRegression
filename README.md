## <font color='#FF45003'>Task: Use Regression with a Crab Age Dataset to determine the age of Crabs <font><a class='anchor' id='top'></a>

### <font color='#FF4500'> `Understanding the task`: The task described in the context is "Crab Age Prediction." The goal of this task is to estimate the age of a crab based on its physical attributes. The dataset provided can be used for classical regression analysis, feature engineering, and understanding the impact of feature engineering in the field of Data Science.

ðŸ“Œ The ultimate objective is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the age of a crab based on its physical characteristics. This prediction can be valuable for commercial crab farmers as it helps them determine the optimal timing for harvesting the crabs. By harvesting the crabs at the right age, farmers can minimize costs and maximize profits. </div>
